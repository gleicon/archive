The videodog config file

I've decided to build my own parser because:

a) dont need too much smartness, just get simple directives
b) dont want to depend on external libraries. my goal is a simple capture program.

So, the keywords are very intuitive, like the included vd.conf can prove.
_FOR NOW_ (tm) videodog only looks for config file at /etc
Please, report me the bugs you find.


The current valid keywords are:

device - sets the video device
width, height, depth - the name says all
output_format - can be raw, pnm, tga, jpg, lower case
effectchain doesn`t work yet
capture_type - says if its a loop or single capture
file - if its a single frame capture, we need a file name or the stdout flag
input_channel - defines 0, 1, 2, 3 ( the input channel )

Time stamp functions:

stamp = defines the stamp text, tags used for times are the same for strftime.
if its null, empty, or doesn`t exist in the config file,  there will be no time stamp.
st_x = the x position inside the image.
st_y = the y position inside the image.
st_scale_w = w scale. its a kind of zoom. if not defined, its equal 1
st_scale_h = same as above, the h scale. not define it, automagically makes it 1.


These are beta code yet. I use a standart 8x8 font as reference to calculate
the font used, even for the scaling. Its not nice or happy as true type fonts, but remember: videodog is intended to not depend on extra libs for easy functionality.
