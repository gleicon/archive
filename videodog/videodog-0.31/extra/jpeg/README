These are some jpeg lib usage examples.
The main reason was: I needed to learn how to work with jpeglib, how to open
a image and convert to another format.


jdec asks for 2 parameters: image.jpeg and image.pnm ( converts to a pnm )
jdec-line is another approach to decompression ( it saves a raw bin file )
jcom is a example to compress a jpeg from a raw or pnm file.


PNM explanation: well...there is no explanation, i dont know nothing about
this image format..i just know that line to put before the raw image with P^
( rgb image, 24 bits ) X, Y, etc ,etc




Enjoy..
