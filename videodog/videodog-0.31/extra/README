VideoDog - extras

These are little examples people always ask me.
Usually they are rough and intended to show how does it works, and not the best way to apply certain libraries.
Enjoy


gtkpnm.c - load a pnm image and displays it. make gtkpnm
gtk_cam.c - just open the video device and start video  make gtk_cam
xputjpeg.c - load a jpeg image into XWindow. Pure xlib code, no gtk. make xputjpeb
bgr2rgb.c - contains a small bgr24 to rgb24 swap function. no make entry
sdlcap-v4l.c - SDL and V4L capture example. Also, it has a usefull subset of videodog v4l functions, easy to use.

jpeg/ - examples on how to compress/uncompress jpeg files.

Use make all to compile them.

There are more code pieces I've uploaded to my website:
