videodog 0.31
FIXED: 
config filel reader ( I hope so)
other input initialization issue


videodog 0.30
Version number upgraded to 0.30 due to TMTBR ( too much time between releases )

ADDED: Experimental motion detection scheme. see motion.c, MOTION.
       Alphablend code - to insert a watermark in every frame

FIXED: extra/gtk_cam.c - little thread bits
       timestamp-seq-channel name, to fix the file order
       from now on, -m will only work with newest bttv drivers. the NTSC|PAL|SECAM changes are made with ioctl(VIDIOCSCHAN) and not with CSTUNER as before.
NEEDED: Better config interface and a way to access all resources

       
videodog 0.23
ADDED: small pdf file trying to explain about v4l and videodog

FIXED: stupid bug in the RGB swap call
       channel attribution mismatch in cycle channels function
       moved v_flags into struct vd_video
       set_channel & cycle_channel now, for every channel, set_picture() and set_mode() to prevent weird images.
       fixed set_mode so a invalid or impossible mode will defaults to NTSC


videodog 0.22

ADDED: 	faster bgr24 swap function (x86 only)
       	cycle input in each capture (set -i to -1)
       	more code examples
	more info about effects (see EFFECTS)
		
FIXED:  small bugs in the name format
	updated man page
	corrected misconception of some loop functions
	ugly bug in the config parser
	Compile without JPEGLib support ( thanks to John Sweeney )
	The vd->channel bug ( thanks to everyone who reported it )

MOVED:  the examples code to extra/


videodog 0.21

ADDED: 	gtk_cam.c, a small and simple gtk capture app. 
       	config path option to the makefile
       	man page
	Implemented filenames as timestamp-sequence-input.format
	Channel names to -s (probe option), reformatted output
	
FIXED: 	lots of little bugs, input channel change checking
       	cleaned the help option. Well, ripped it off. -h just shows a simple banner with the compile time options. refer to the manpage to check out the help
	Some frames missed the rgb24 swap - everything's ok now
	Fixed the channel selection function
	This was by far one of most massive rewrites and bugfixes version.
	Some conceptual changes are on the way and I hope to do that rewrite and code cleaning ASAP


videodog 0.20

ADDED: "mode" directive in the config file ( how dumb a man can be ... ), a timestamp function with scaling and many text options, bumped version to 0.20, some tuneups in the file recording functions.
FIXED: -h option that wasn't working, a memory leak in the read_conf function.


videodog 0.14

ADDED: - option to dump the image to stdout (no matter what format). Another viwer, gtkpnm, gtk-based pnm viewer (not required to build videodog).
FIXED: (at least I tried to) another bug in channel changing w/ some bt848 cards
DISABLED: the -DDEBUG flag. 


videodog 0.13

ADDED: Config file (see CONFIG_FILE for more info), new effects: mirroring, lowpass filter ( smoothing ), highpass filter (sharpening), mark_areas (object locator), TARGA image format for saving TGA 24 bits images, channel_threshold (effect), predator (effect);
FIXED: bug who doesn`t allow input changing and non-jpeg compilations to work properly. this bug does affects the jpeg compile too, with the loop option. Some non closed file descriptors. Fixed another malloc/free bug. Commented the effects section ( sorry, the negative effect was turned on in the last release).
MOVED: the command line options to a separate file to ease the config file implementation


videodog 0.12

FIXED: sobel and laplace convolutions, some slowness reported in channel changing. A bug who forced the channel to be set every time, even if the user doesn't specify it.
ADDED: noise effect (salt), negative image effect


videodog 0.11

As I receive many mails asking about image processing with videodog, I put some rough functions to show how to hook the image and transform or process it. See EFFECTS and README for more info.
This is the main improvement of this release, along with an install patch I got from Petter Reinholdtsen.
I've included a simple xlib jpeg viewer, xputjpeg. See README
BUGFIX: now the -w 1 capture works ok ( no more segfaults )

videodog 0.10

Another bug fix release, mostly due to tips sent by John D. Rowell from AppWatch.
Command line options bugs, and such
Corrected some segfault due to unproper command line handling, and added error msgs.


videodog 0.09

Its just a bug fix release, cleaned up some race conditions, introduced some compile time options. This fix an annoying bug in the loop about the rgb swap scheme.


videodog 0.08

This release splits the source code, implements multiple buffer capture (a capture loop), and includes some clean-ups. There are some command line options modifications.
